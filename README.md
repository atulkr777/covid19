# covid19 Analysis 

Analysis of cases in India using datset available on government site. I used Numpy,Pandas and matplotlib for analysis and presenting findings.

Post Analysis, I also visually represented the cases in Indian states.

Further, I used the fbprophet package for automated forecasts.

"Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well."
